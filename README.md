# QQC2StyleBridge

This is a style for QtQuickControls 2 that uses QWidget's QStyle for painting, making possible to achieve an higher deree of consistency between QWidget-based and QML-based apps.
NOTE: the application must be a QApplication rather than a QGuiApplication instance in order for this style to be used
